# How to contribute

If you're interested in contributing then please do, any help you can give is greatly appreciated. If you're contributing by reporting bugs, then please use the issue tracker with necessary information. If you're contributing new features / fixes, then please do it in a separate branch and perform a pull request. If you're wanting to contribute in any other ways such as hosting any parts of the main website or a contributing a node, then also get in touch.

Development is happening in the development branch.

Please bear in mind that if you're contributing code, it would be ideal to conform to the coding standards below.

You can set gulp up to watch files if you're doing any front-end development work (including writing plugins) by running `gulp watch`.

#### Javascript
A definitive style guide hasn't been used up to now. But it's something I'd like to slowly incorporate in and keep all of the code at the same standards, at the moment everything tries to follow these standards:
* Always use semi colons to trail lines.
* Curly braces always on same lines.
* Camel case only, no _ (I know some of the code base is using non camel case, this will be migrated over time)
* Variable declaration in bulk separated by commas
* No whitespace in between parenthesis
* Tabs only no double spaces

### Rewrite - 0.2.0
#### alpha
The first usable version of the rewrite is 0.2.0-alpha which will be a basic system a far cry from a final version but it's nearing complete. A live version will be online for users to use or install their own on their own servers.

The roadmap can be found [here](https://github.com/ircanywhere/ircanywhere/wiki/0.2.0-alpha-Roadmap).

#### beta
The next steps are defining a new roadmap fixing critical bugs and any other minor issues that crop up. There wont be too many feature additions in this version - might be some minor additions but no huge feature improvements until the APIs are deemed more stable.

The roadmap can be found [here](https://github.com/ircanywhere/ircanywhere/wiki/0.2.0-alpha-Roadmap).

#### 0.2.0 final
Once a beta version is released and the system is in a relatively stable state - all critical bugs and crashes are removed. This version will improve on the plugin (client and backend) APIs. More feature additions will be slowly introduced and performance tunings will be worked on. Frontend code will be documented like the backend and I'll start work on creating an API wiki + generated docs.
